                <p>Born to benevolent parents, who sadly declined the marvelous opportunity to name their child Tom Tom, Skyler “Windmill” Tom is a man who can best be described as deep. A deep threat, often laying out onto his back to make the most difficult and inconceivable of catches. A deep thinker, who will break the most pregnant of silences with startling and profound proclamations such as, “dope” or “two boxes of pasta is probably too much for one person, right?” A deeply intimidating mark, whose trademark “rotational vortex” arm movement is so fast and furious that it flusters even the best throwers into turnovers, even the best observers into giving immediate yellow cards, and served as inspiration for the design of the huge wind turbines that dot the countryside. A deep crouching pong player, whose unconventional yet unstoppable “Crouching Skyler, Hittin’ Cups” shooting stance delivers fear into the hearts of opponents and golden Natural Light elixir into their stomachs. A deep sleeper, who would hate to let superfluous things such as “alarms,” “phone calls,” and “the first day of Sectionals” get in the way of the 8 hours of sleep necessary to keep his fertile mind and supple body in tip-top shape. And finally, he’s a deep defensive player, regularly seen bidding out of nowhere to poach D some poor scrub, playing airtight man defense, and generally being dope at everything.</p>
