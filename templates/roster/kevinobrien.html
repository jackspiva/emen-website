                <p>Kevin O’Brien came into the world to a fanfare of trumpets and the roar of a lion. At birth, he was given the nickname Kevin Garnett (KG for short) and proceeded to scream and pound his chest like a howler monkey in heat, dominating the youth basketball scene with a strong pro game and an even stronger fro game. With offers from the Timberwolves, Celtics and Harlem Globetrotters on the table, The Big Ticket shocked the world by taking his prestigious talents to the Medford/Somerville area and the world of D-III hoops. He quickly discovered that college ball wasn’t his shtick and heard that the frisbee team was looking for dudes with ups. KG had once touched the net (!!!) in high school, so he knew this was the sport for him. Since that fateful day, The Notorious K.O.B. has made a living skying nerds and telling police officers that he’s 22. When KaGe isn’t on the field slanging biscuits, you can find him building circuits and seducing ladies, often at the same time. Watch out world, because Kevin Garnett has entered the arena and he’s taking names. </p>
